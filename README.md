Run the script shake_pendulum from MATLAB to generate the figures needed for MANUSCRIPT-NUMBER.
If the file shake_pendulum.mat is deleted, then the data will be generated from scratch.
This may take a few minutes depending on the power of the computer.
If the file shake_pendulum.mat is present, then the raw data is read from the file and the figures are generated.
